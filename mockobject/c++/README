This is a simple demo showing the usage of mock objects for intergation testing in C++.

A carrier software module in a positioning system (e.g. an automatic crane in a habour) has
to be tested. The carrier depends on thre drive objects (e.g. step motors) for the X, Y and Z positions.

In the test it should be verified, that the drives are contolled properly by the carrier.
For this reason the drive class is abstracted by an interface, to be able to pass mock
objects with verification functions of the same type as the real world drives.

The carrier must be designed to support the interface type instead of the real drive type.
This tecnique is known as design for testability.

In a real world project many mocks are created that serve a test system and simulate
real behaviour to the callers instead of executing the real functionality.
A tester can set up many test in parallel to the real software to inspect subsystems
according to the integration test strategy.
